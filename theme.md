# Theme Overview - Team 7 (Semester 1, 2023)

## Style.css
Within the style.css file, the CSS is mostly structured into three main parts: header, body, and footer. These parts are organized into separate classes and arranged accordingly. Any modifications to the theme's style should be made within this file.

To ensure easy identification for site users, we have made the button colours bright and contrasting against the background and other elements. The buttons are a vibrant red, serving as eye-catching calls to action and the first elements users notice. The body of the theme, where most of the text is displayed, features a white background. This enhances the legibility of dark text and directs the focus to the body content, including the calls to actions, as it has a striking visual separation from the header and footer.

## Links page
Within the Links page, the links are contained within two columns. Depending if the link is referring to a club or music help, the link should be added to the correct section and then the appropriate column.

## Posts
Posts are used on the Events, Magazines, Photo Gallery, and Helpful Guide to Chord Charts pages. If any work is done on either page where a post is created, modified or deleted, the work must be done in the Posts section of Wordpress, and the post must be assigned to the correct category. 

## Photo Gallery page
In order to add a new photo to the Photo Gallery page, users must provide their name, email, and the local image they selected. Once they submit, the image will be checked for any inappropriate or irrelevant content, before admin uploads the image to the site's Media Library, where it can then be added to the photo gallery posts category. 

## Comments
Comments can be posted on each photo from the photo gallery by selecting the appropriate post of photos (e.g. Photo Gallery 1) and leaving a reply. Afterwards, the comment will appear under the appropriate photo post.

## Typography
### Font
For TTCMA Inc, we used the serif font typeface "Rockwell", designed by Monotype Corporation for the majority of the website. This font is user-friendly, attractive, easy-to-read, and (as requested) "country styled".

## Header.php

## Footer.php
To make changes to the footer content (HTML, not CSS), you need to access the 'footer.php' file. The footer has been structured into three different content divisions (container, row, column) to align with the site's goals and emphasize separate links that serve different purposes. For example, the "About Club" page is separated from the contact links to make it more prominent, matching the dropdown menu for the "About Us" section in the site's header.  

To add new elements to the footer, you can include new links within each column using the "li" tag and turning them into links with "a". Alternatively, if you need a new section with multiple links, you can add an entirely new column using the column-footer class. Adjustments to the column widths would be made in the style.css file. The footer colour is the same as the header, #32373C (dark shade of cyan blue), creating a distinct contrast with the site body. It is a darker colour that helps highlight the calls to action within the body content.
